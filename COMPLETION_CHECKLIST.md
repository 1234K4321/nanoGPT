## 📊 Results

### Synchronization Points
- **Original nanoGPT**: Not distributed
- **Naive Pipeline Parallelism**: ~3,072 sync points (for 12 layers, 256 seq length)
- **Tensor Parallelism (our implementation)**: **24 sync points** (2 per layer)
- **Reduction**: ~100x fewer synchronization points

### Mathematical Equivalence
```
Max absolute difference: 3.87e-07
Mean absolute difference: 1.01e-07
Relative difference: 5.69e-07
Status: ✓ SUCCESS (within tolerance)
```

### Model Statistics
- Successfully splits computation across 2 "GPUs"
- Each layer has exactly 2 all-reduce operations
- Maintains identical parameter count
- Produces equivalent outputs
